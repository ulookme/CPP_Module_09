Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange
Exercise : 00
Bitcoin Exchange
Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, BitcoinExchange.{cpp, hpp}
Forbidden functions : None
You have to create a program which outputs the value of a certain amount of bitcoin
on a certain date.
This program must use a database in csv format which will represent bitcoin price
over time. This database is provided with this subject.
The program will take as input a second database, storing the different prices/dates
to evaluate.
Your program must respect these rules:
• The program name is btc.
• Your program must take a file as argument.
• Each line in this file must use the following format: "date | value".
• A valid date will always be in the following format: Year-Month-Day.
• A valid value must be either a float or a positive integer between 0 and 1000.
You must use at least one container in your code to validate this
exercise. You should handle possible errors with an appropriate
error message.

You must create a program with these constraints:
• The program name is RPN.
• Your program must take an inverted Polish mathematical expression as an argument.
• The numbers used in this operation and passed as arguments will always be less
than 10. The calculation itself but also the result do not take into account this rule.
• Your program must process this expression and output the correct result on the
standard output.
• If an error occurs during the execution of the program an error message should be
displayed on the standard output.
• Your program must be able to handle operations with these tokens: "+ - / *".

You must create a program with these constraints:
• The name of the program is PmergeMe.
• Your program must be able to use a positive integer sequence as argument.
• Your program must use a merge-insert sort algorithm to sort the positive integer
sequence.
• If an error occurs during program execution, an error message should be displayed
on the standard output.
You must use at least two different containers in your code to
validate this exercise. Your program must be able to handle at
least 3000 different integers.
It is strongly advised to implement your algorithm for each container
and thus to avoid using a generic function.
